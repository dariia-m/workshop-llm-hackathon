  In a large bowl, cream together 1 cup of softened unsalted butter and ½ cup
  of white sugar until smooth. Beat in 1 egg and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
  Gradually stir in 2 cups of all-purpose flour until the dough forms. Finally,
  fold in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips. Drop spoonfuls of dough onto an
  ungreased baking sheet and bake at 350°F (175°C) for 10-12 minutes, or until
  the edges are lightly browned. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for
  a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy!
